**Tutorial 1**

1. Complete the steps in checkpoint 1a to set up your file system, git repo, etc.
> Update your git regularly as you work on the checkpoints!
2. Complete `checkpoint1b.py` according to the comments in the file. Then run the script (`python checkpoint1b.py`), and make sure it has outputted a new file `starbucks_clean.csv` in the data/ folder.
> You will need this csv for the second checkpoint, but you don't need to include it in your git repo

**Tutorial 2**

3. Complete the exercises in `checkpoint2a.ipynb`
4. Complete the workflow in `checkpoint2b.ipynb`
> For both notebooks, make sure the file you submit contains all the outputs and graphs (i.e. run all cells before you save)
