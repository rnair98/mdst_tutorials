Checkpoint 1b

*First complete the steps in checkpoint1a.pdf

Here you will create a script to preprocess the data given in starbucks.csv. You may want to use
a jupyter notebook or python terminal to develop your code and test each function as you go... 
you can import this file and its functions directly:

    - jupyter notebook: include the lines `%autoreload 2` and `import preprocess`
                        then just call preprocess.remove_percents(df) to test
                        
    - python terminal: run `from importlib import reload` and `import preprocess`
                       each time you modify this file, run `reload(preprocess)`

Once you are finished with this program, you should run `python preprocess.py` from the terminal.
This should load the data, perform preprocessing, and save the output to the data folder.
